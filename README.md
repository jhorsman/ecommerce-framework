SDL Web E-Commerce Framework v1.1
====================================

This is a framework to enable E-Commerce functionality for SDL Web.
It contains ECL providers and DXA modules for various E-Commerce systems.

Right now it provides connectors for:

* Fredhopper (http://www.fredhopper.com)
* SAP Hybris (http://www.hybris.com)
* Salesforce Commerce Cloud (Demandware) (http://www.demandware.com)

The framework has been verified both on SDL Tridion 2013 SP1 and SDL Web 8 (8.1.1) using DXA 1.6.

New functionality in the v1.1 version:
* New OData based micro service for E-Commerce including clients for Java and .NET
* Decoupled E-Commerce connectors, either they can be plugged into the micro service or they can be co-located in DXA (java only)
* DXA modules for .NET providing the same functionality as the Java DXA modules
* Support for product variants
* ECL connector for Fredhopper
* Support for latest Demandware version (v16.8)
* Separation of DXA module into two parts: one generic (controllers & models) and one example module (example HTML views)
* Supports DXA 1.6

Concepts
---------

The E-Commerce framework consists of:

* Generic E-Commerce APIs for product categories, product queries, product details, product variants, cart and in-context edit controls
* Generic DXA module for Java & .NET consuming above E-Commerce APIs
* DXA module with example views using the white label design
* Generic navigation DXA module for hybrid navigation support (right now only provides mega navigation)
* A number of connectors implementing the E-Commerce APIs (Fredhopper, Hybris, Demandware)
* OData based micro service for the E-Commerce APIs using the same setup as the standard SDL Web micro services
* Generic E-Commerce framework for ECL providers
* A number of ECL providers for retrieving categories and products (Hybris, Demandware)
* OData based micro service 

Currently there are the following connectors implementing fully or partly the E-Commerce APIs:

* Fredhopper (Categories, Search, Product Detail, Product Variants, Edit controls)
* Hybris (Categories, Search, Product Detail, Cart)
* Demandware (Categories, Search, Product Detail, Product Variants, Cart)
* Dummy for test & demo purposes (Cart)

The intention with the connectors is that you could mix&match what kind of combo you want, such as use Fredhopper for Categories&Search and Hybris for Detail&Cart.
As the the service interfaces are designed to be decoupled from eachother it is straight-forward to setup these kind of combinations.

The Fredhopper connector also provides some extensive support for inline editing (create new, edit and delete) of:

* Facets
* Promotions
* Modifications
* Rankings 
* Redirects
* Synonyms

The generic DXA module that consume the E-Commerce APIs. It contains right now the following:

* E-Com driven navigation items (in mega navigation). Can be mixed with content driven navigation items.
* Widgets for:
    * Product Listers for presenting products in category and search result pages
    * Facets 
    * Breadcrumbs
    * Promotions
    * Product details
    * Mega navigation (facets + promotions)
    * Search box (in the header)
    * Search spelling feedback
    * Cart (minimised in the header + detail)
* Page controllers for category and detail pages for SEO friendly pages
    * No 1:1 mapping is required  between a lister/detail page and a Tridion page. Tridion instead manage a set of template pages which are used for the different category/detail pages
    * The experience of those template pages can be overridden. The controllers uses a search pattern to find the best match template page for a certain category/detail pages
* Some widgets can be placed outside the control of the category/detail controllers such as facets, promotions and listers. The actual category & view type can be configured on widget level through either category paths or ECL links. This allows easy creating of campaign/landing pages etc.
* Localization support, i.e. the different language, currency and catalog mappings per publication

In addition there is a DXA module with a set of HTML views (in JSP or Razor) implementing the default E-Commerce templates. The views are based on the DXA White Label HTML design.

The ECL providers allows easy access to categories and products which makes it easy to associate references in for example the different E-Commerce widgets (listers, facets etc). 
In addition the ECL provider gives the possibility to drag & drop categories & products directly on pages as well. This allows the possibility to do both E-Commerce 1:1 (i.e. one Tridion page per category/product) and rule based (through the controllers).

Prerequisites
----------------

The framework requires DXA 1.6 which includes support for SDL Tridion 2013 SP1 and SDL Web 8.

The connectors to the E-Commerce systems has been verified against the following:

* SDL Fredhopper 7.5.x & 8.1.x
* Demandware OCAPI 16.8
* Hybris (Omni Commerce Connect) OCC v1 on hybris Commerce Suite 5.x


Getting started (Java)
------------------------

For Java you can either have the connectors co-located or use the OData micro service. There is an example webapp for the white label design available to be able to get started quickly.
To setup the example webapp you need to do the following:
 
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sdl/ecommerce-framework`
2. Configure the dxa.properties (under ecommerce-framework-example-webapp/src/main/resources) for selected connector. Following instructions given in respective README for each connector to set it up:
    * [Fredhopper](./connectors/fredhopper-ecommerce-connector/README.md)
    * [Hybris](./connectors/hybris-ecommerce-connector/README.md)
    * [Demandware](./connectors/demandware-ecommerce-connector/README.md)   
3. Compile the code and package a WAR file by doing the following in the root of the project: 

    ```
    mvn package -Pexample-webapp -P[connector #1] -P[connector #2] ...
    ```
 
    * Example: Compiles the webapp with the Fredhopper connector:  `mvn package -Pexample-webapp -Pfredhopper` 
    * If using the OData micro service, use the following: `mvn package -Pexample-webapp -Podata-client`
4. Deploy the generated WAR to your JEE application server/servlet container. Make sure the webapp runs as the root webapp.
5. Setup CMS as described below


Getting Started (.NET)
------------------------

The .NET version of the E-Commerce DXA modules requires the OData micro service. Follow the below steps to setup the modules: 

1. If you do not have a DXA.NET setup (for SDL Web 8) you can easily do this by following the instructions given here: [Installing the web application (.NET)](http://docs.sdl.com/LiveContent/content/en-US/SDL%20DXA-v6/GUID-8633F5AE-8472-4D53-AD38-A7A33DD1F5A3)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sdl/ecommerce-framework`
3. Either open up the solution dxa.net/SDL.ECommerce.sln or add the VS projects under dxa.net to your Visual Studio solution
4. Set the environment variable %DXA_SITE_DIR% to point to your DXA Site path (in visual studio or in your IIS instance) 
5. Restart Visual studio and rebuild the solution. Verify so E-Commerce Areas and DLLs are copied to your site folder
6. Configure E-Commerce micro service in Web.config of your site:

   ``` 
    <!-- E-Commerce Framework -->
    <add key="ecommerce-service-uri" value="http://localhost:8097/ecommerce.svc"/>
   ```

7. Setup CMS as described below    

An overview of the different .NET projects are given here: [E-Commerce DXA.NET](./dxa.net/README.md)


Getting Started with the OData micro service
----------------------------------------------

Follow the below steps to setup the the OData micro service (which can be run on Windows and Linux/Unix systems):

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sdl/ecommerce-framework`
2. Compile and package the OData micro service by doing the following in the project root:
     * mvn clean package -P[selected connector, e.g. 'fredhopper', 'hybris', or 'demandware']
3. Unzip the generated 'ecommerce-framework-odata-service-1.1.0-install.zip' file in an appropiate directory on your target environment
4. Configure the connector and locale settings in the config/application.yml file. Some examples are given in the file. For more information about the connector settings, please refer to:
    * [Fredhopper](./connectors/fredhopper-ecommerce-connector/README.md)
    * [Hybris](./connectors/hybris-ecommerce-connector/README.md)
    * [Demandware](./connectors/demandware-ecommerce-connector/README.md)  
5. The service can be started by using the bin/start.sh or bin/start.ps1 scripts. If using Windows you can install the micro service as a Windows service by running the 'installService.ps1' script.
    * For more information about different deployment options, see [Installing Spring Boot applications](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/deployment-install.html) 
6. Verify that the service up & running by typing the following in your browser: http://[server name]:8097/ecommerce.svc/Categories. It should list all top level categories in the current E-Commerce system.


Getting Started (CMS)
------------------------

1. If you have not installed DXA in SDL Web CMS, you can follow the instructions given here: [Importing the DXA Publications into Content Manager](http://docs.sdl.com/LiveContent/content/en-US/SDL%20DXA-v6/GUID-EDB49D8A-DCC3-45E7-B809-6A8B377C4FEA) 
1. Install the CMS packages by following instructions given in: [Install CMS packages](./cms/README.md) 
2. Publish out the settings page, HTML design + the header include page. 
3. Publish out pages under 'Categories' and 'Products'. And the 'Cart' and 'Search Results' pages.
4. If needed adjust the localization properties for the selected connector (under Building Blocks/Settings/E-Commerce/Site Manager)
    * This is only needed when running the connector co-located in the DXA webapp (DXA.Java only)
4. Start up your DXA web application and verify that the E-Commerce main categories are visible in the mega navigation
5. In addition (optional) you can also install one of the ECL providers. See instructions given in:
    * [Hybris ECL](./ecl/hybris-ecl-provider/README.md)
    * [Demandware ECL](./ecl/demandware-ecl-provider/README.md) 
    * [Fredhopper ECL](./ecl/fredhopper-ecl-provider/README.md)


Future enhancements
---------------------

Below are some enhancements to be consider in future versions:

* Support for checkouts
* Improved category experience such as sorting, slider facets etc
* Improved cart model with support for promo codes etc
* Hybrid search (content/E-Commerce)
* Search suggest
* OAuth authentication on the E-Commerce micro service
* Generic ECL provider using the OData micro service (to minimize the integration points)
* Available as NuGet packages/Maven central artifacts
